# Day 2 - Web - Cookies and the Web

## Web server and communication technologies
- The HTTP protocol is a client-server protocol to provide communication between a client and a webserver. 
- HTTP requests are similar to a standard TCP network request; however, HTTP adds specific headers to the request to identify the protocol and other information.
## Cookies

### Understanding cookies
- HTTP is a stateless protocol. When you send requests to a web server, the server cannot distinguish your request from someone else's request.
- Cokies are the solution.
- Cookies are tiny pieces of data (metadata)Â or information locally stored on your computer that are sent to the server when you make a request.
- Cookies can be assigned any name and any value allowing the webserver to store any information it wants.

### Cookie manipulation

- Cookie manipulation is taking a cookie and modifying it to obtain unintended behavior determined by the web developer.
- Cookie manipulation is possible because cookies are stored locally on your host system, meaning you have complete control over them and modify them as you please.
