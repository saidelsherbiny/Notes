# Day 4 - Web - Authentication, Authorization and Fuzzing

## Authenticaton vs Authorization

### Authentication
- Authentication is the process of verifying a userâ€™s identity, establishing that they are who they say they are.
- Authentication means include:
	1.  A known set of credentials to the server and user such as a username and password  
	2.  Token authentication (these are unique pieces of encrypted text)  
	3.  Biometric authentication (fingerprints, retina data, etc.)

### Authorization
- Authorisation is a term for the rules defining what an authenticated user can and cannot access
- Admin access vs regular user access on a website

## Fuzzing
- Fuzzing is an automated means of testing an element of a web application until the application gives a vulnerability or valuable information.
