# 20. Time for some ELForensics

## Hashes
- A file hash, or simply a hash, is a mathematical algorithm that analyzes the data of the file and outputs a value, which is its hash.  
- File hashes let us know whether a file is legitimate or not based on its verified file hash.
- Command in powershell:
`Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 file.txt`

## Strings.exe
-  You can use the Strings tool to peek inside this mysterious executable file.
-   Command in powershell:
 `c:\Tools\strings64.exe -accepteula file.exe`

## ADS
 - Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS (New Technology File System). 
 - Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA) and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. 
 - Natively Window Explorer doesn't display ADS to the user. 
 - There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files.
 - Command in powershell:
`Get-Item -Path file.exe -Stream *`
- Malware writers have used ADS to hide data in an endpoint, but not all its uses are malicious. 
- When you download a file from the Internet unto an endpoint there are identifiers written to ADS to identify that it was downloaded from the Internet.
## Launching hidden file
-  Windows Management Instrumentation can be used
-  Command in powershell:
`wmic process call create $(Resolve-Path file.exe:streamname)`
