## Introduction to x86-64 Assembly
- Computers execute machine code, which is encoded as bytes, to carry out tasks on a computer.
-  Before an executable file is produced, the source code is first compiled into assembly(.s files), after which the assembler converts it into an object program(.o files), and operations with a linker finally make it an executable.

## Radare2
- Used to disassemble binaries(translate machine code to assembly, which is actually readable) and debug said binaries(by allowing a user to step through the execution and view the state of the program).
