## Exploring Burp suite

- Stage 1: Unauthenticated stage (without logging in)
- Stage 2: User stage (login as a user)
- Stage 3: Admin stage (test as an admin)

## SQL Injection attacks
### What is SQL Injection?
- SQL injection is an attack in which malicious SQL statements are injected into a SQL database. 
- SQL injection is easy to avoid, but still happens often!
- If successful, we can read sensitive databases, extract information, modify databases, and potentially even get a shell.

### Common SQL Verbs
- SQL statements begin with verbs. Let's take a look at a few common verbs:
	- SELECT - Retrieves data from a table
	- INSERT - Adds data to a table
	- DELETE - Removes data from a table
	- UPDATE - Modifies data in a table
	- DROP - Delete a table
	- UNION - Combines data from mutiple queries
	- WHERE - Filters records based on specific condition
	- AND/OR/NOT - Filter records based on multiple conditions
	- ORDER BY - Sorts records in ascending/descending order

### Bypassing login page with SQL Injection:
#### Steps:
1. Try random email and password and forward to repeater in Burp
2. Check the response 
3. Attempt SQLi in the username field with:
	- Input: test' OR 1=1; --'
- Database pulls credentials from database with:
	- SQL: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email='test' OR 1=1 --';

 #### Blind SQL injection:
 
 - Input: test' (sleep 10)

## SQL Injection Defenses 
- Defense 1: Parameterized Statements
	- Ensure inputs (parameters) ar used safely in SQL statements
	- Example: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email =?";
	- Example: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email ='" + email +"'";
- Defense 2: Sanitizing input


## Broken authentication
- Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management are critical to protect against authentication-related attacks. There may be authentication weaknesses if the application:
	- Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing
	- Permits brute force or other automated attacks
	- Permits default, weak or well-known passwords (admin:admin)
	- Uses weak or innefective credential recovery and forgot-password processes, such as "knowledge bases answers"
	- Uses plain text or weakly hashes passwords
	- Missing MFA
	- Exposes session IDs in URL
	- Does not rotate session IDs after successful login
	- Does not properly invalidate session IDs (session fixation)

### Testing for Broken authentication

- Check for invalid email or password prompts
- Check forgot password prompt

## Sensitive data exposure

- Rather than directly attacking crypto, attackers steal keys, execute man-in-the-middle atacks, or steal clear text data off the server, while in transit, or frmo the user's client, e.g. browser. A manual attack is generally required. Previously retrieved passwords databases could be brute forced by GPUs.

## XML External Entities (XXE)

### What is XXE?

- XXE payloads online
- File upload XXE, abusing XML parsing



## Broken Access Control

- User gets access to somewhere they shouldn't (Bypass access)
- Inspect element and changing uid

## Security Misconfigurations
- Missing hardening
- Privilege misconfiguration, unecessary features are enabled or isntalled 
- Latest security features are disabled or not configured securely
- Error handling reveals stack traves or other overly informative error messages to users


## XSS - Cross site scripting

- DOM Based XSS: [https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20171214](https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20171214)

- XSS Game: [https://xss-game.appspot.com/](https://xss-game.appspot.com/)

## Reflected XSS
- Injection is reflected to us, never gets stored onto the server
- Client side

## Stored Xss
- Gets stored on the server
- Server side

## DOM XSS
-  Document Object Model
-  Client Side

> Use intruder with burp and a bunch of payloads to try test for xss

## Insecure deserialization
- When we have something malicious, serialize the exploit, application deserializes it and excutes it
- ysoserial

## Using components with known vulnerabilities

- Abusing known vulnerabilities to compromise an application


## Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

- Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring and active resposne occurs any time:
	- Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions are not logged
- Important to detect and monitor suspicious activities
