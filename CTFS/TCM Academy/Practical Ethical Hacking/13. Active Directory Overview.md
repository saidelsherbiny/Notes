# Active Directory Overview
## What is Active Directory?

- Directory service developed by Microsoft to manage Windows domain networks
- Stores information related to objects, such as Computers, Users, Printers, etc.
	- Think about it as a phone book for Windows
- Authenticates using Kerberos tickets.
	- Non-Windows devices, such as Linux machines, firewalls, etc. can also authenticate to Active Directory via RADIUS or LDAP

## Why Active Directory
- Active directory is the most commonly used identity management service in the world
- Can be exploited without ever attacking patchable exploits. 
	- Instead, we abuse features, trusts, components and more

# Physical AD Components

## Domain Controllers

- A domain conroller is a server with AD DS (directory store) server role installed that has specifically been promoted to a domain controller

### Features:

- Host a copy of the AD DS directory store
- Provide authentication and authorization services
- Replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest
- Allow administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources

## AD DS Data Store

- The AD DS data store contains the database files and processes that store and manage directory information for users, services,  and applications

### Features:
- Consists of the Ntds.dit file
- Is stored by default in the %SystemTool%\NTDS folder on all domain controllers
- Is accessible only through the domain controller processes and protocols

# Logical Active Directory Components

## AD DS Schema (blueprint/ rulebook)

- Defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory
- Enforces rules regarding object creation and configuration

|Object Types|Function|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Class object|What objects can be created in the directory|1. User 2. Computer|
|Attribute Object| Information that can be attached to an object|1. Display name|

## Domains
- Domains are used to group and manage objects in an organization

### Features
- An adminstrative boundary for applying policies to groups of objects
- A replication boundary for replicating data between domain controllers
- An authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to imit the scope of access to resources

## Trees
- A domain tree is a hierarchy of domains in AD DS

### All domains in the tree:
- Share a contiguous namespace with the parent domain
- Can have additional child domains
- By default create a two-way transitive trust with other domains 

## Forests
- A forest is a collection of one or more trees

### They:
- Share a common schema
- Share a common configuration partition
- Share a common global catalog to enable searching
- Enable trusts between all domains in the forst
- Share the Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups

## Organizational Units (Ous)
- OUs are Active Directory containers that can contain users, groups, computers, and other OUs

## OUs are used to:
- Represent your organization hirarchically and logically
- Manage a collection of objects in a consistent way
- Delegate permissions to administer groups of objects
- Apply policies

## Trusts
- Trusts provide a mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain

|Types of Trusts|Description|
|---|---|
|Directional|The trust direction flows from trusting domain to the trusted domain|
|Transitive|The trust relationship is extended beyond a two-domain trust to include other trusted domains|

- All domains in a forest trust all other domains in the forest
- Trusts can extend outside the forest

## Objects

|Object|Description|
|---|---|
|User|1. Enables network resource access for a user|
|InetOrgPerson|1. Similar to a user account 2. Used for compatibility with other directory services|
|Contacts|1. Used Primarily to assign e-mail addresses to external users 2. Does not enable network access|
|Groups|1. Used to simplify the administration of access control|
|Printers|1. Used to simplify the process of locating and connecting to printers|
|Shared folders|1. Enables users to search for shared folders based on properties|
