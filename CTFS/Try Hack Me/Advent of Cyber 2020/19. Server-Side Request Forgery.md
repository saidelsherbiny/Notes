# 19. Server-Side Request Forgery

## Intro

- Allows attackers to force the web server to make requests to resources it normally wouldn't.


## Example

- A web app may have the functionality to produce screenshots of other websites when a user supplies a URL. This is perfectly valid functionality, however, URLs can also be made for internal IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.1, 10.10.10.10, 127.0.0.1 etc.) as well as internal-only hostnames (e.g. localhost, WIN2019SERV.CORP).
- The above is an example of Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

http://10.10.200.236/?proxy=http%3A%2F%2Flist.hohoho.localtest.me

localtest.me redirect to localhost
