## Privilege escalation

- Only Administrators can modify system settings or change the permissions of other users resources like files and folders

> What is Privilege escalation?
> *It is the proces of increasing the current privileges of a user to the one above.*

### Directions of privilege escalation

#### Horizontal Privilege Escalation:

- Using the intended permissions of a user to abuse a vulnerability to access another user's resources who has similar permissons to you. (User A account with access to X to access a User B account with access to Y)

#### Vertical Privilege Escalation:

- Using a vulnerability that allows you to perform actions acting as a higher privileges account (Escalating privs to admin).

```bash
# Useful python shell spawn

python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

```bash
# Searching for files
find / -name FILE_NAME 2> /dev/null
```

### Task

1. Login via ssh
2. Run linpeas.sh
3. Run `find / -perm -u=s type -f 2>/dev/null`
4. Discover that `/bin/bash` has the SUID bit set
5. Go to GTFO bins and find that when bash has the SUID bit set, run `/bin/bash -p`
6. Gain root shell and read flag in `/root/flat.txt`
