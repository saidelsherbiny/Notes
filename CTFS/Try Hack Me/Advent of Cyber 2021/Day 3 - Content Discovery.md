# Day 3 - Web - Content Discovery

## What is content discovery?
- Content is the assets and inner workings of the application that we are testing. 
- Contents can be files, folders, or pathways that weren't necessarily intended to be accessed by the general public.
- Content discovery is a useful technique to have in our arsenal because it allows us to find things that we aren't supposed to see. For example, we may be able to find:  
	-   Configuration files
	-   Passwords and secrets
	-   Backups
	-   Content management systems
	-   Administrator dashboards or portals

## Default credentials
- Web applications and services often come with a default pair of credentials. 
- Developers leave these credentials in place so that you can quickly get started with the platform (with the hopes that you will change them). 
- However, as you'll come to discover, not everyone does, or in fact, applications often include other accounts that are not well documented. 
- SecLists also provide a wordlist for default credentials, which you can find [here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials).
