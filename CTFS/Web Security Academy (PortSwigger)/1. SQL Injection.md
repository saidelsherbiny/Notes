## What is SQL injection (SQLi)]
- SQL injection allows attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This allows the attacker to view data that the are not normally able to see.
- An attacker could leverage this attack to cause more damage compromising the back-end server or causing a denial of service attack.

## SQLi examples
-   [Retrieving hidden data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection#retrieving-hidden-data), 

### Retrieveing Hidden Data
- This is when you can modify an SQL query to return additional results
- Instead of showing gifts that have been release only, you can change the SQL query to show all items, both released and unreleased.
#### LAB 1
- SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
- Solution: `filter?category=Gifts%27+or+1=1%20--`

### Subverting application logic
- You can change a query to interfere with the application's logic
- Used for login bypass; input username and end sql query with a comment there without checking for the password

#### LAB 2
- Bypass login
- Solution: username field - `admin' or 1=1 --` password - `asdf`

### UNION attacks

- You can retrieve data from other database tables when the results of an SQL query are returned within the application's responses. 

- For example:
	- `SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'`
	- `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`
- Requirements for a UNION query to work:
	- The individual queries must return the same number of columns
	- The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries

##### Determining the number of columns required (keep going until error occurs);
	- ' ORDER BY 1--
	- ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL --
#### Lab 3
- Use the null query
- Solution: category field - `filter?category=' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL --`

>  The reason for using `NULL` as the values returned from the injected `SELECT` query is that the data types in each column must be compatible between the original and the injected queries. Since `NULL` is convertible to every commonly used data type, using `NULL` maximizes the chance that the payload will succeed when the column count is correct.

##### Finding colums with a useful data type 
- Since the interesting data is mostly in string form, you need to look for the column in the original query results whose data type is, or is compatible with, string data
#### Lab 4
- You basically run UNION SELECT NULL query to look for the column that does not throw back an errror once you change the location of the string data type
- Solution: `filter?category=' UNION SELECT NULL,'A5ygzM',NULL --`
